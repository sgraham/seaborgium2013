To build:

In a VS2010 prompt (cl, link, etc. in the PATH):

  build\env.bat             :: or otherwise get Win8 SDK set in LIB and INCLUDE
  python build\configure.py --debug
  third_party\ninja\ninja       :: build\env.bat also puts this dir in the PATH
  out\sg_test
  out\sg

Currently, you'll have to also have Python 2.7 (x86) installed. Available:

  http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/

or some tests and the main binary will fail.
