To build mingw test data, get mingw-get-inst

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/

and install it. Then,

  mingw-get upgrade
  mingw-get install g++
  mingw-get install gdb-python

TODO(scottmg): Add this to configure.py, and build the test binaries
automatically.
